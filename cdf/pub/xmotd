This is a reminder that food and drink are NOT
permitted near the CDF workstations.

This policy is necessary to protect our equipment and
to maintain a quality working environment in the
labs.

Past experience has demonstrated that when the policy
is not strictly enforced, the labs quickly become
dirty and cluttered with refuse. Given that our labs
are often quite crowded to begin with, a dirty
workspace certainly does not contribute to pleasant
working conditions.

Consequently, CDF staff will be suspending the
accounts of anyone found with food, drinks or
packaging (wrappers, pop cans, coffee containers) at
their workstation.

Users will be held accountable for such items in their
workstation area, whether they are responsible for
bringing them in to the lab or not.  So look around
you and tidy up!

Thank you
